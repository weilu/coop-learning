abstract = "This paper explores the existence of stable research teams, when the preferences of each agent depend on the set of researchers who are collaborating. We introduce a property over researchers’ preferences, called top responsiveness, guaranteeing the existence of stable research teams configurations. We also provide a stable mechanism, induced by the so-called top covering algorithm, which is strategy-proof when researchers preferences satisfy top responsiveness. Furthermore, we find that, in this framework, the top covering mechanism is the only strategy-proof mechanism that always selects stable allocations."

abstract = "Alcalde and Revilla [Journal of Mathematical Economics 40 (2004) 869–887] introduce a top responsiveness condition on players’ preferences in hedonic games and show that it guarantees the existence of a core stable partition. In the present note we strengthen this observation by proving that under top responsiveness even the strict core is non-empty."
