\subsection{Bottom Responsive Games}
Bottom responsive games can be viewed as the counterpart of top responsive games, where a player's utility is derived from the absence of disliked players. For a game to satisfy bottom responsiveness, two conditions are required:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item if for all $S' \in Av(i, S)$ $T' \in Av(i, T)$, $ S' \succ_i T'$ then $S \succ_i T$
  \item if $Av(i, S) \cap Av(i, T) \neq \emptyset$ and $|S| \geq |T|$ then $S \succeq_i T$
\end{enumerate}

Where $Av(i, S)$ denotes the avoid sets of player $i$ in coalition $S$, formally defined as:

$Av(i, S) = \{S' \subseteq S: (i \in S') \wedge (S' \preceq_i S'' \forall S'' \subseteq S)\}$

If in addition to the above two conditions, a game also satisfies $|Av(i, S)| = 1$ for all $i \in N$ and all $S \in \mathcal{N}_i$, then it is strongly bottom responsive.
