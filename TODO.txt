2. check weakly better off edge case [DONE]
3. check how efficient the top covering impl is [DONE]
4. understand how algo 1 works [DONE]
1. payoff: 1 + 1/|s| smaller the coalition the better [DONE]


game with 142 players generated in: 14.116243839263916s
top covering algo completed in: 18.29806089401245s


Questions:
all preferences ranked after self is solely depends on size?
does it discover full preferences? how to treat missing preferences?
walk through algo 1 preference discovery


Questions:
If total for votes is more than against, but less than half the parliment, does the bill pass?

failed bill value?

TO-TRY:
- change value function to account for participation
- change value function to account for how close the victory was
- give losing coalition some small value

TODO:
- why so many 0s in votes.csv? Yair
- how to match member ID to votes.csv col name? Yair
- consistent bib hack. Alan

TODO:
- check though data preprocessing code [DONE]
- account abstained as participation [DONE]
- run 100 times on 3/4 and participations accounted see if the generated structure is stable
- Maybe: initiator gets more value on passing bill?
- paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0004370215001198
- send photo [DONE]
- community/social network approach/Inducing graph relations what result does it produce?
- search/split algo that produces outcome that's consistent (ilp solver)

Goal:
5-page write-up:
- Data description: what are the data records we have, what do they mean etc.
- Algorithms implemented

TODO (17 Jul):
- 8 pass/reject inconsitent cases: which dataset is wrong [DONE]
- redownload data [DONE]
  - save law stats raw data
- run 100 times on 3/4 and participations accounted see if the generated structure is stable [DONE]
- paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0004370215001198
- search/split algo that produces outcome that's consistent (ilp solver): start with grant coalition, split until stable
- community detection
- visualize party lines & those in the government: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-fourth_government_of_Israel

TODO (29 Jul)
- why are the two algorithms (pac & original) not producing something more similar?
- reference 16 proposition 2.21
- email Yair about social welfare max vs core solution

2 Aug
- social welfare max not meaningful [DONE]

TODO (2 Aug)
- run with loop 100 times with sampling p1 [DONE]
- writing p2
- how many cases of violation in preferrence profile p4
- implement friends & enemy model p3
- check out Haris Aziz research
- include data -> pref -> solution vs data -> solution approach in writing [DONE]
  - theory basis for why data -> solution works: https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~zick/papers/learning.Sols.2019.pdf 1.4.1 theorem 2.4, theorem 3.2
  - VC dimension, how hard it is to learn a hypothesis class of functions for binary classification => solution dimension (similiar to graph dimension) for game theory solution concept

Questions (for 8 Aug meeting)
- instead of take and remove w samples, we sample w = 3/4 n with replacement and without removal. How does it change the formal bound?
- 3/4 sample 100 runs outputs identical
- 3/4 sample output not core stable
- author order?

TODO (8 Aug)
- meet with Yair before presenting [DONE]
- why 100% loop vs without loop diff results?
  - ordering of full dataset [YES]
  - look at member indexed 27 and 133, see if it's tie breaking mechanism that caused the slight diff
- example bills and look at output of valuation function
- B game instead of top responsive

Questions (for 16 Aug)
frenemy:
  - appreciation of friends (has strict core) => top responsive, if symmetric => SSNS (strict strong nash stability): https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.4754.pdf
  - aversion of enemies (has core) => bottom responsive, if symmetric => (strong nash stable)
update value function based on AoF see if top cover generates same results as AoF
implement bottom avoiding algorithm: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1700921
top covering algo guarantees strict core: On top responsiveness and strict core stability
partition as a result of top covering algo is individually artional: Top responsiveness and nash stability in coalition formation games
