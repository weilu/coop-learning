Questions:
all preferences ranked after self is solely depends on size?
does it discover full preferences? how to treat missing preferences?
walk through algo 1 preference discovery


Questions:
If total for votes is more than against, but less than half the parliment, does the bill pass?

failed bill value?

TO-TRY:
- change value function to account for participation
- change value function to account for how close the victory was
- give losing coalition some small value

TODO:

TODO (29 Jul)
- why are the two algorithms (pac & original) not producing something more similar?
- reference 16 proposition 2.21
- email Yair about social welfare max vs core solution

2 Aug
- social welfare max not meaningful [DONE]

TODO (2 Aug)

- writing p2
- how many cases of violation in preference profile p4
- implement friends & enemy model p3
- check out Haris Aziz research
- include data -> pref -> solution vs data -> solution approach in writing [DONE]
  - theory basis for why data -> solution works: https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~zick/papers/learning.Sols.2019.pdf 1.4.1 theorem 2.4, theorem 3.2
  - VC dimension, how hard it is to learn a hypothesis class of functions for binary classification => solution dimension (similiar to graph dimension) for game theory solution concept

Questions (for 8 Aug meeting)
- instead of take and remove w samples, we sample w = 3/4 n with replacement and without removal. How does it change the formal bound?
- 3/4 sample 100 runs outputs identical
- 3/4 sample output not core stable
- author order?

TODO (8 Aug)
- meet with Yair before presenting [DONE]
- why 100% loop vs without loop diff results?
  - ordering of full dataset [YES]
  - look at member indexed 27 and 133, see if it's tie breaking mechanism that caused the slight diff
- example bills and look at output of valuation function
- B game instead of top responsive

Questions (for 16 Aug)
frenemy:
  - appreciation of friends (has strict core) => top responsive, if symmetric => SSNS (strict strong nash stability): https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.4754.pdf
  - aversion to enemies (has core) => bottom responsive, if symmetric => (strong nash stable)
- top covering algo guarantees strict core: On top responsiveness and strict core stability
- partition as a result of top covering algo is individually rational: Top responsiveness and nash stability in coalition formation games
- update value function based on AoF see if top cover generates same results as AoF -> yes
- implement bottom avoiding algorithm: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1700921 [DONE]
- Are top covering & friend algorithms equivalent? Yes! proof sketch. friend algo is also more efficient
- Is sampling really necessary in our experiment? Yes
- bottom avoiding algorithm:
  - Given this algorithm finds a core, is finding core of an aversion of enemies game really NP hard?
  - complexity: O(n^3) for aversion to enemies model

TODO (16 Aug)
- iid needed for PAC framework to work
- 75% samples for robustness
- show coalition disintegration process
- partial ordering using just for & against: I prefer to be the coalition in the same group as me over the other coalition
- smallest cc always a cycle? [NO] a -> b -> c <-> d c -> a
- writing:
  - game theory: perscriptive - if want to have properties, use this model, descriptive - this is how human behave, this is what game theory predict would be stable.
    - want to show that other models like clustering or community detection doesn't produce results as good (TODO)
  - choose PAC framework because it's efficient to generate core - only need poly number of samples
- community detection:
  - Jure Leskovec
- sample complexity - related to dimension of the problem (how weird the problem is).
  1/epsilon * log(1/delta) * n

TODO (19 Aug)
- formalize proof in methodology
- write out experiment results
- visualize partition [DONE]
- comparisons
  - LP result
  - hierarchical clustering


Notes (23 Aug)
- grand coalition partition: overspecified problem
- is the order the coalitions are generated meaningful? earlier coalitions are more popular and persistent?

TODO  (23 Aug)
- viz: remove individual names [DONE]
- comparison: LP or clustering [DONE]
- formalize proof in methodology [DONE]
- include the result without restrictive loop
- surviving member across all/90% runs, identify unstable coalitions

26 Aug:

Questions:
- proof largest part of the SCC procedure
- better clustering algorithm?
- information distance measure, any commonly used? mutualized mutual information score? [CHECK]
- measure against left, right, center?
- meaningful to include results from deterministic runs? [CHECK: use as motivation]

Notes:
- committee lines
- Members singled out from YB:
  - Lieberman head of the party, left the Knesset half-way because becoming a minister. opposition
  - Orly Levy left the party. Faught her own fight and often penalized for it
- use older Knesset 80s (super low barrier of entry, back then 1 seat, now about 4 seats) or 90s
  - 81-84 more ambitious government but data might be more noisy (don't use this)
  - 84-88: national unity government. party lines should be broken
  - 92-96 two parties fracturing.
- sanity check using the joint list
- how to agg multiple coalition structures? Joint list has 4 subparties, see if they get grouped together: https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%94_%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%A4%D7%AA
  - weighted edge representing grouped together, only for joint list. Check out Tomas Michalale
  - heatmap colored by number of times clustered together
- select a partition that minimizes total info dist from all partitions from other runs
- the PAC version produces 2 large coalitions as a result of sampling from a distribution.
  - include it early in the paper, use it as motivation
- writing
  - missing:
    examples of pref models
    what is the model? party members have preferences which we don't observe
    introduction: overview, roadmap of what we are doing
  - point out interesting case study. highlight things like the joint list, Lieberman and Orley Levy


Notes (29 Aug)
- put it in a theorom environment [DONE]

  - introduce data in introduction, then ref in preliminaries
  - check the order or presentation of sections
  - data section: general introduction of Knesset. People are not used to systems with more than two parties
- add aggregation
- introduction: 1 column and a bit
  - what's the problem, why is it important, what we did
  - take into account of strategic behavior. resistant to people acting in selfish ways.
  - Both data driven and takes strategic behavior into account
  - rich data in the preference data domain. Has ground truth political alliances, party affiliation.
  - Liberman being singled out is bazaar (check attendance, check his individual votes against)
  - first time showing efficacy of hedonic game in real world

TODO:
- check proof (Yair)
- send related work on Basian coalition formation + other recent works on coalition formation (Yair)
- DB scan for clustering (Alan)
- need a better title: data driven approach to learning hedonic games: a case study with Knesset / voting data
- add something about Knesset / Israel political: amnon rubinstein on structure of israel politics
- check 19th Knesset see if ultra orthodox parties: Shas, United Torah Judaism still aligned with the right wing parties
  - if align: deeper under current
  - if not: it's just politics
Ack: Tohah + an undergrad + my mother + knesset data team
