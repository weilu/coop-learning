Past works on hedonic preferences focus on the existence and computational aspect
of stability concepts in various sub-classes of hedonic coalition formation games
\cite{Aziz:2012:ESH:2343776.2343806}, \cite{aziz_savani_moulin_2016}.
The specific subclass we are interested in is top responsive games,
which captures the idea that a player's utility is derived from
the most preferred set of other players in her coalition.
\citenameyear{ALCALDE2004869} show that top responsive games guarantee
the existence of a core stable partition,
which is discoverable through the Top Covering Algorithm.
\citenameyear{DIMITROV2007130} simplify the original Top Covering Algorithm
and proved that it not only constructs a core, but a strict core.
\citenameyear{Dimitrov2006TopRA} also show that adding the mutuality condition
to the simplified top covering algorithm produces a Nash stable partition.
\citenameyear{Aziz:2012:ESH:2343776.2343806} further prove that with mutuality the partition produced
is in fact strict strong Nash stable for any top responsive game.
We formulate our empirical experiments upon recent work by \citenameyear{ijcai2017-380} on PAC stability.
